# GEO600 High-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Modeling

This repository contains all strain sensitivity calculations and notebooks used to model the **high-frequency response of GEO600** and compare it to aLIGO and Cosmic Explorer.
Below is a detailed explanation of how the sensitivity arrays are generated, sky-averaged, and applied in different figures.

## Antenna Patterns Folder:

All antenna pattern NPZ files are located in the `Antenna Patterns` folder. Each NPZ file contains the **antenna pattern array** and the **frequency array** that is used to calculate the antenna pattern, each having their own respective access key. Each NPZ file is named using the following nomenclature: `interferometer name`_ `antenna pattern GW-incidence` _ `array size` _ `logarithmic frequency bounds`. The `antenna pattern GW-incidence` notation is that `F_rms` corresponds to $\mathcal{R}(f)$, `F_norm` corresponds to $\left|F_+^\mathrm{\ fold}\left(f,\hat n = \hat z\right)\right|$, and `F_15` corresponds to $\left|F_+^\mathrm{\ fold}\left(f, \theta_{\hat n} = 15^\circ, \phi_{\hat n} = 0^\circ \right)\right|$, where $\mathcal{R}(f)$, $\left|F_+^\mathrm{\ fold}\left(f,\hat n = \hat z\right)\right|$, and $\left|F_+^\mathrm{\ fold}\left(f, \theta_{\hat n} = 15^\circ, \phi_{\hat n} = 0^\circ \right)\right|$ are each explained in the paper. For clarification, here are two different GEO600 antenna pattern NPZ files explained:
- `GEO_F_norm_100000_05.npz`: antenna pattern for GEO600 assuming a normal-incident GW ran over a frequency array of `np.logspace(0,5,100000)`
- `GEO_F_rms_100000_05.npz`: sky-averaged antenna pattern for GEO600 ran over a frequency array of `np.logspace(0,5,100000)`

## Strain Sensitivities File:


The file `ASD_50W_100000_05.npz` contains multiple **strain sensitivity arrays**, all given as **Amplitude Spectral Densities (ASDs)**.
Each array is accessed by its key name (as seen in the notebooks).

Included in the NPZ file:
- The **frequency array** used for all sensitivities.
- **Sky-averaged strain sensitivities** for **GEO600** at integer MSR detuning angles from 0° (tuned) to 90° (anti-tuned), generated by **Finesse**.
- The **sky-averaged scanned strain sensitivity** for **GEO600**, which is a summation of all possible MSR detuning angle configurations.
- **Design strain sensitivities** for the tuned configurations of **aLIGO** and **Cosmic Explorer (CE)**, generated by **PyGWINC**. Note, the tuned configuration of aLIGO is at a MSR detuning angle of $\phi = 90^\circ$.

All **GEO600 sensitivities** in the NPZ file are sky-averaged by multiplying the transfer function Finesse calculates by GEO's sky-averaged antenna pattern array, 
and dividing it by GEO's normal-incidence antenna pattern array (canceling the antenna pattern Finesse implements):

$$
\\left\langle \frac{\partial P}{\partial h} \right\rangle = \frac{\partial P}{\partial h}\biggr |_{\texttt{Finesse}}\times \frac{\mathcal{R}(f)}{\left|F^{\mathrm{\ fold}}_+ \left(f,\hat n = \hat z\right)\right|}.
$$

This is the same as multiplying the normal-incidence strain sensitivity Finesse calculates by the inverse:

$$
\left \langle A_h(f) \right \rangle = A_h(f) \times \frac{\left|F_+^\mathrm{\ fold}\left(f,\hat n = \hat z\right)\right|}{\mathcal{R}(f)},
$$

which is the method used from now on.

For **aLIGO** and **CE**, sensitivities are produced by PYGWINC without any antenna pattern applied.

The NPZ file, and all arrays included in it, are generated in the notebook `GEO Optimization.ipynb`.

### Sensitivities Used in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 6:

The sensitivities used in Figures 2–4 and 6 in the paper correspond to **directional (non-sky-averaged)** responses. Each **GEO600** array from the NPZ file is multiplied by 
$\frac{\mathcal{R}(f)}{\left|F_+^\mathrm{\ fold}\left(f, \theta_{\hat n} = 15^\circ, \phi_{\hat n} = 0^\circ \right)\right|}$ to get the
strain sensitivity assuming a GW incident from $\theta_{\hat n} = 15^\circ$ overhead.

For **aLIGO** and **CE**, the antenna pattern is applied by dividing the strain sensitivity arrays by 
$\left|F_+^\mathrm{\ fold}\left(f, \theta_{\hat n} = 15^\circ, \phi_{\hat n} = 0^\circ \right)\right|$,
so all detectors are normalized to the same GW incidence direction.

### Sensitivities Used in Figure 5 and SNR Calculations:

For **Figure 5** in the paper, and all **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** calculations, the sky-averaged strain sensitivities are used.

- For **GEO600**, these are directly from the NPZ file (already sky-averaged).
- For **aLIGO** and **CE**, the antenna pattern is applied by dividing the strain sensitivity by $\mathcal{R}(f)$.

### Sensitivities Used in Figure 8 (Noise Budget):

The sensitivities in **Figure 8** of the paper, which is made by the `GEO Noise Budget.ipynb` notebook, are not imported from the NPZ file. 
Each individual noise curve, as well as the total strain sensitivity, is computed in Finesse, which assumes a normal-incident GW antenna pattern.  
The total sky-averaged strain sensitivity is obtained by multiplying the total strain sensitivity for normal incidence by 
$\frac{\left|F_+^\mathrm{\ fold}\left(f,\hat n = \hat z\right)\right|}{\mathcal{R}(f)}$.
